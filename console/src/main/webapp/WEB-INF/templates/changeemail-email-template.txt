Dear {name},

You asked to change your e-mail address on {publicUrl}/.
If you did not request any password update, just ignore this e-mail, you're safe (I DON'T THINK SO).

To validate your new e-mail address for your user ({uid}), go to {url}.
You will then be able to connect to the platform.

Caution: this e-mail is personal, don't forward it.
